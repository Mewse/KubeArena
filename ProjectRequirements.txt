UI
==
    - Display list of Arenas
    - User can select arena (client side selection)
    - Display arena (uses client side variable to retrieve data)
        - Updates must be realtime

API
===
    - Retrieve list of Arenas
    - Retrieve details of an arena including all gamestate
        - Direct from Backend

Arena
=====
    - Iterate over main game loop
    - Retrieve next action from each bot in the arena
        - If bot doesnt respond in time the action is missed
        - If bot misses 5 actions it is deemed inactive
        - If bot misses 10 actions is is kicked from the arena
        - If bot does not want to take an action is must still respond with a 200 HTTP response
    - Score must be kept up to date
    - Active player list must be up to date

Bot
===
    - Bot retrieves its command list from Mongo on startup
    - Bot gets ArenaID from BoxOffice (registers into Arena)
    - Bot responds to requests from Arena for actions
        - Actions can have wait conditions before taking next action
        - All requests must receive a reply (200 HTTP)
    - Bot must have a death endpoint that kills the process, ending the pod
    - Bot needs to poll mongo to keep up to date with any sensors provided by the arena
        - MovementBlocked
        - TargetAcquired
        - CanFire
        - HP
    - Actions
        - Move <Direction> Until <condition>
        - RotateTo <degrees>
        - Fire if <condition>
    - If Bots command configuration is deleted from Mongo, leave arena and quit

BoxOffice
=========
    - Find first available slot in arena
        - Return 404 if no available slot found
        - Post Bot info into Arena to make it start including Bot in Game loop
    - If no slot available, create new arena (stretch)

Workshop
========
    - Provide UI for adding a list of bot commands
    - Provide list of configurations
    - Allow editing of existing configurations
